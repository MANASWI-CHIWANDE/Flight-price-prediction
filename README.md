## Introduction

Flight Price Prediction is an Android app that allows users to predict the price of flights based on various input parameters, including the source, destination, arrival date, departure date, and the number of stops. This app utilizes machine learning algorithms to make predictions, providing users with estimates to plan their flights more effectively.

## Features

- Predict the price of flights between different cities.
- Customize the travel dates to get accurate predictions.
- Input the number of stops to refine the prediction further.
- User-friendly and intuitive interface.
- Real-time prediction updates.

## Usage

1. Launch the Flight Price Prediction app on your Android device.

2. Enter the source and destination cities for your flight.

3. Select the departure and arrival dates using the date picker.

4. Input the number of stops (non-stop, one-stop, etc.) for a more accurate prediction.

5. Tap the "Predict" button to get the estimated price of the flight.

6. The app will display the predicted price for the specified journey.

## ML API

The Machine Learning (ML) API used in this app is available at [https://github.com/MANASWI-CHIWANDE/Fly-Foresight](https://github.com/MANASWI-CHIWANDE/Fly-Foresight). The API is responsible for handling the prediction logic and providing the flight price estimates to the Android app.

To integrate the ML API with the Android app, the app sends the necessary input parameters (source, destination, arrival date, departure date, and number of stops) to the API, which then processes the data and returns the predicted price to the app.
